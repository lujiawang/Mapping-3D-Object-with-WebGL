Preview picture is in the folder.

This lab contains one html file, six js files, one json file contains a model I created, and a bunch of png pictures including a texture I created myself.

To run the lab, download the entire package, the index.html can be open in Edge

UPDATE 11/20/2020: Edge not working for CROS protection. Open cmd -> cd <CHROME> location -> chrome.exe -allow-file-access-from-files -> open index.html

- By clicking buttons on the web page, texture mapping and environment mapping will be applied to the environment cube; the basic object; and a parametric surface the model stand on. Self animation was applied to the object.
