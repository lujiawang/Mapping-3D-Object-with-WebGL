Preview picture is in the folder.

This lab contains one html file, six js files, one json file contains a model I created, and a bunch of png pictures including a texture I created myself.

The index.html can be open in Edge

- By clicking buttons on the web page, texture mapping and environment mapping will be applied to the environment cube; the basic object; and a parametric surface the model stand on. Self animation was applied to the object.
